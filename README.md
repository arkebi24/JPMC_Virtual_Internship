## Task 1 

- Interface with a stock price data feed
- Interface with a stock price data feed and set up your system for analysis of the data
- We want to process the data feed of stock A and stock B’s price to enable us to analyse when trading for the stock should occur.

## Task 2

- Use J.P. Morgan Chase frameworks and tools
- Implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization
- Take an incomplete setup of Perspective, i.e. a graph that updates manually, and make it work with the code from Task 1 such that it now updates automatically by continuously requesting from the server application

## Task 3

- Display data visually for traders
- Use Perspective to create the chart for the trader’s dashboard
- Use Perspective to generate a chart that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing manner for traders to monitor this trading strategy. Basically, you have to modify the existing live chart to be able to (1) track and display the ratio between the two stock prices (2) show the historical upper and lower bounds of the stocks' ratio (3) and finally, show 'alerts'  whenever these bounds are crossed by the ratio.
